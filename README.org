#+TITLE: Viconf

*DISCLAIMER*: This tool is not yet ready to be used at all. Do not even think about testing this yet!

A framework for pushing network config to devices.

Under heavy development.

This tool is meant to stand along Vico - where Vico generates the config, Viconf
pushes it to the device.

* Installation
