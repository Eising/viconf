#+TITLE: Viconf project

* Introduction
This file is the agenda and project file for the Viconf project. It includes milestones, todos and all that.

* Milestones

** TODO Version 0.5
   Version 0.5 will be the initial test release

*** General Improvements
    The following general improvements need to be in order

**** TODO Deployment ready docker-compose file
     The docker compose file needs to include all the necessary dependencies,
     such as celery worker and beat.

**** TODO Backup/restore
     Backup and restore needs to be tested thoroughly.

*** Code improvements

**** DONE PEP8 linting
     CLOSED: [2018-08-07 Tue 13:04]
     Make sure the code conforms to PEP8.

**** TODO API documentation
     The API needs proper documentation.

*** App improvements

**** TODO Cleanup of unused code
     All unused modules/apps need to be cleaned up.

**** TODO Template exception handling
     Make sure that mistyped templates are handled properly.

**** TODO Inventory enhancements
     Make sure that the inventory module actually handles the types configured,
     and that editing is smooth and working.

**** DONE Audit logging
     CLOSED: [2018-08-09 Thu 11:03]
     An audit trail would be nice. Maybe for v1.0 instead.
     Easyaudit has been implemented.


**** DONE Undelete area
     CLOSED: [2018-08-09 Thu 10:53]
     Almost all objects that are deleted still exist in the DB. An interface to undelete would be helpful.
     This is probably a low hanging fruit.

*** Provisioning improvements

**** TODO Properly log all NAPALM transactions
     All interactions with actual live equipment needs to be logged properly for
     forensic and debugging purpose.

**** TODO Make sure that drivers are handled correctly.
     This might be complicated and hard to test, but at least IOS, IOSXR and
     JUNOS need to be tested.

**** TODO Make sure that devices with no driver are handled correctly.
     These are devices that aren't handled at all.


** TODO Version 1.0

*** General Improvements

**** TODO Unit testing framework
     We need proper unit testing to catch bugs and regressions

**** TODO Frontend testing
     I had this running on Vico, with Selenium for javascript testing. This needs to run here too.


*** Template improvements

**** TODO Rewrite template handling
     This is a rather complex idea inspired by NSO: Instead of building
     complicated syntaxes into the templates, we should build it in to the
     fields logic. So the template should only contain variables (including
     lists but not more), and then the data type page should be extended to
     allow configuration of all fields, including inventory selection, python
     sandbox, etc. Plugins should come in here as well.

***** Example Template Model:
      #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
        {
          "key1": {
                  "type": "string",
                  "validator": "asn"
                  },
          "key2": {
                  "type": "inventory",
                  "inventory_id": 3,
                  }
        }

      #+END_EXAMPLE

*** App improvements
**** TODO Full API
     Everything needs to be accessible via API
